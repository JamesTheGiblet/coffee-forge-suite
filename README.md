# ☕ The Coffee Forge Suite: A Deterministic Coffee Science Ecosystem

The Coffee Forge Suite is an end-to-end simulation pipeline that models the entire lifecycle of a coffee bean—from its chemical transformation in the roaster to its pharmacokinetic impact on the human brain.

Built with Vanilla JavaScript, the suite utilizes deterministic mathematical models to simulate real-world physics, chemistry, and biology, providing an interactive "sandbox" for coffee professionals and enthusiasts.
🏗️ The Simulation Pipeline

The suite is designed as a linear data chain. The output of one module serves as the physical and chemical input for the next.

1. 🔥 RoastForge (The Chemical Origin)

    Focus: Thermodynamics and Maillard Reactions.

    Physics: Models bean temperature based on batch density, airflow, and drum speed.

    Chemistry: Tracks the degradation of chlorogenic acids (acidity) and the development of aromatic volatiles and caffeine retention.

    Handoff: Exports bean brittleness and density to the next stage.

2. 💧 WaterForge (The Solvent Foundation)

    Focus: Water Chemistry and Mineralization.

    Chemistry: Allows customization of mineral content (Magnesium, Calcium, Bicarbonates) to simulate "soft" vs. "hard" water profiles.

    Standards: References SCAA water quality standards for optimal extraction potential.

    Handoff: Exports Total Hardness (ppm) and Alkalinity to the extraction physics engine.

3. ⚙️ GrindForge (The Physical Bridge)

    Focus: Particle Geometry and Distribution.

    Physics: Uses a Box-Muller transform to simulate a bimodal distribution of particles (peaks for main particles and microscopic fines).

    Metrics: Calculates total available surface area (cm²) and thermal friction generated by the burrs.

    Handoff: Exports surface area index and flow resistance to the brewing model.

4. ☕ BrewForge (The Extraction Physics)

    Focus: Fluid Dynamics and Solvation.

    Physics: Models extraction yield based on water hardness (ppm), temperature stability, and mechanical agitation.

    Methodology: Includes custom logic for Espresso (pressure-based), Pour Over (percolation), and French Press (immersion).

    Handoff: Exports the final Caffeine Dosage (mg) and Bioavailability markers.

5. 🧬 CaffeineForge Pro (The Biological End)

    Focus: Pharmacokinetics and Human Metabolism.

    Biology: Models the binding of caffeine to adenosine receptors using a three-phase response model (Growth, Saturation, and Negative Returns).

    Personalization: Adjusts metabolic half-life based on genetic profiles (CYP1A2 variants), body mass, and tolerance levels.

    Result: Visualizes the predicted Alertness Curve and sleep disruption risk.

🛠️ Technical Features

    Shared State Architecture: Uses the browser's LocalStorage and Window.postMessage() API to automatically sync data between iframes without a backend.

    Real-Time Data Viz: Powered by Plotly.js and HTML5 Canvas for dynamic graphing of ROR (Rate of Rise) and metabolic decay.

    Procedural Audio: Utilizes the Web Audio API to synthesize the acoustic "cracking" sounds of coffee roasting.

    Responsive Engine: 60fps procedural animations for particle physics and fluid levels.

🧪 Scientific Accuracy & References

The models implemented in this suite are based on established specialty coffee research and pharmacological data:

    Roast Chemistry: Based on the kinetics of the Maillard reaction in food science.

    Extraction: Utilizes the SCAA Extraction Control Chart standards (18%–22% yield).

    Pharmacokinetics: Modeled on the Cornelis et al. (2016) meta-analysis of CYP1A2 genotype associations and FDA caffeine safety guidelines.
